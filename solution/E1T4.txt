Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
InstanceRolePolicy-C3 allows access to all S3 buckets and all actions. 
We should allow only read access to Free Recipe S3 bucket alone(least privilege).
secret recipe bucket should be enable encrption for security reason.


# Poor practice 2
The web service instance is in the public subnet and its security group exposes port to all IP addresses.
The instance should be moved to a private subnet and security  group should allow ALB only.
