# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack

Based on the description of UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/SSHBruteForce,  
GuardDuty detect that an attacker is using brute force attack on port 22. 

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.

Based on the GuardDuty documentation, this service uses CloudTrail event logs, VPC Flow Logs and DNS logs to detect an attack. 
It uses ML techniques to detect an attack. For the attack performed in this exercise, AWS might have used VPC Flow logs to detect this attact as API calls were not used.
Similarly, the attack was performed inside VPC so DNS logs are probably not used.
