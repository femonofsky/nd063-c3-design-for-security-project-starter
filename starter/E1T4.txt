Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
The web service instance shouldn't allow full access to all S3 buckets.
The web service should have the least privilege access to the S3 bucket.


# Poor practice 2
The web service instance is in the public subnet and its security group exposes port to all IP addresses.
The instance should be moved to a private subnet and security  group should allow ALB only.
